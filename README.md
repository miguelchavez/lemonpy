Description
===========

lemonPy is a proof of concept for the next generation of lemonPOS.
The code name lemon py reads like "**lemon pie**", 'py' refers to python, that is the language in which the project is written.

lemonPy uses Qt4 via *pySide*, and uses *django* as a helper for database creation and administration application in the first stage and its ORM to
help the rapid development [we hope so].
